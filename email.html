<title>BUILD FAILURE!!</title>

<body>
<p>Hi Chaps,</p>
<p>Guess what? The build has failed!! Can whoever checked/merged into the "development" branch recently check to see that what they've done compiles correctly (at least).</p>
<p>Enclosed is the console log for the build.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Shaun.</p>
